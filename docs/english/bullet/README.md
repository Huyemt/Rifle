## Foreword
<font color="bule">**Everything starts with that eternal love.**</font>
## Background
In order to enable developers of all platforms to develop `Rifle` modules at will, we design an explanatory language instead of `Java` to write modules.
## Introduce
`Bullet` is an explanatory language at present, and `JIT` technology will be used to make it a faster and more efficient hybrid language in the future.
<br>
Its grammar is more human and easy to understand. Can interact with it in the `Java` environment
# Advantage
Compared with Java:
```
1. With high-precision operation.
2. Use less code than Java to achieve the same function.
3. Dynamic types give developers a flexible development environment.
4. Grammatical humanity, grammatical sugar is efficient and practical.
5. Built-in many practical functions, with considerable speed.
```
Compared with Python:
```
1. It is highly similar to its syntax, but better than Python.
2. Only a small part of the code needs to be modified to transplant the two codes to each other.
3. More humane and convenient list and dictionary operation.
```
