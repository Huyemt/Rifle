# Foreword
In order to highlight the similarities and differences of each Bullet program and improve the convenience of interaction when interacting with other languages,
<br>
we have developed a new concept called `Program Attribute`.
# Introduce
The `Program Attribute` is not allowed to be called and changed by the `Bullet` program.
# Example
Use `#` to decorate an assignment statement, which is the `Program Attribute`.
```bullet
# name = "MyFirstBulletProgram"
# version = "1.0"
# authors = ["Huyemt", "Teaclon", "Kevin"]
```
