<kbd>Rifle</kbd> is a console-like terminal tool developed based on <kbd>Java</kbd>.<br>
<br>
We can use a specific command to complete the corresponding work, or you can run a command as a task in the background.<br>
For the convenience of customizing the command, we have built in a variety of parameter format types. If you are not satisfied with the parameter classes we provide, you can also customize the appropriate parameter types according to your own format.<br>

<kbd>Rifle</kbd> has task scheduling and can run the code to be executed in the background. At the same time, we support users to edit their own modules and run them in <kbd>Rifle</kbd>.
